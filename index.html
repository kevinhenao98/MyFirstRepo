          <h2>Latest Story: Queens Voc Students Break Records 
in Fight Against Breast Cancer!</h2>
<h3>By: Farhan Zaman</h3>
           <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Eighty Queens Voc students 
helped fight against breast cancer, 
at the annual Making Strides 
Against Breast Cancer Walk on 
Sunday, Oct. 19, at Flushing 
Meadows-Corona Park.
The students walked three 
miles and raised a recordbreaking $6,715, making them the 
"number one school in Queens for 
fundraising,” said Mr. Vega, the 
coordinator of student activities. 
Initially Queens Voc students set 
a school goal of $3,000, and Mr. 
Vega encouraged every student 
who walked to raise $50 or more. “This year we exceeded our 
goal by double the amount, and 
students once again had lots of 
fun. Teachers really went out of 
their way to sponsor students. 
We had a lot of support from the 
teachers,” said Mr. Vega. 
Last year Queens Voc was 
again awarded a pink, silver, and 
gold banner, signifying they raised 
more than $5,000. The money raised will be used 
to help provide care for the breast 
cancer fighters after they have 
dealt with chemotherapy. 
Students from different grades 
and SLCs attended the walk. The two biggest fundraisers were 
senior Mildred Alvarez, who 
raised $800 and freshman Philip 
Papaccio, who raised $410. 
“When I heard about the Breast 
Cancer walk, I thought it would 
be fun, but I didn’t think I’d raise 
$410. I had a lot of fun, and it made me feel great because it was for a good cause. I can’t wait for next year,” said Phillip Papaccio. “Every year that I’ve participated in the Breast Cancer Walk, it has been more successful than the previous year,” said junior Tia Singh. “It’s just a fun day walking to support people that you don’t know personally. Advocates who participate not only help breast cancer, but they 
help create a caring atmosphere,” she said.
